Media Indexer and Player

This Python script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application called "Media Indexer and Player" using the tkinter library. The application is designed for efficiently browsing directories, viewing folder contents, searching for media files, and playing them directly from the interface. Additionally, it provides comprehensive support for media metadata extraction, as well as robust configuration and state management.
Key Features and Functionalities
1. Library Imports

The script leverages a diverse set of libraries, such as:

    os for file system operations.
    tkinter for GUI development.
    configparser for saving and loading configuration settings.
    re for regular expression-based searches.
    sqlite3 for database management.
    mutagen and ffprobe for extracting and handling media metadata.
    concurrent.futures, threading, and subprocess for parallel processing and efficient task handling.

2. Tkinter Setup and Themed Style

    The script initializes the main tkinter root window and applies a modern theme using ThemedStyle from the ttkthemes package, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of the application.

3. Function Definitions

    Metadata and Image Handling: Functions for extracting and displaying detailed media metadata (e.g., title, album, genre) and cover art images from media files using mutagen and ffmpeg.
    Event Handling: Functions for managing mouse wheel scrolling, window resizing, and keyboard shortcuts for intuitive and efficient user interaction.
    Configuration Management: Functions to persist user settings, such as the last opened directory, window dimensions, and the position of UI elements, using configparser.
    Folder and File Navigation: Functions for browsing directories, opening folders, searching for media files, and dynamically updating the display as needed.
    Database Interaction: Functions to create, reset, and train a SQLite database for efficient storage and retrieval of media file metadata. The database can be used to enhance search functionality and improve performance.

4. Enhanced UI Layout

    Top Frame: Contains essential controls, including a button for opening folders, a search entry box, a search button, and a settings button for user configuration.
    Paned Window: Splits the main interface into two sections: a folder view and a media file view, both equipped with scrollable frames for easier navigation.
    Folder and Media Frames: Utilizes Canvas widgets to render folders and media files in a structured grid layout, with support for smooth scrolling.

5. Tooltips and Media Metadata

    Displays informative tooltips containing media metadata and cover art when hovering over media files, providing users with a rich and intuitive browsing experience.
    Efficiently parses and formats metadata for a clean and organized tooltip layout.

6. Search Functionality

    A robust search system that supports direct file searches or advanced database queries.
    Users can apply multiple filters, such as title, genre, actors, and comments, to refine their search results.
    The application uses sqlite3 to store and efficiently retrieve metadata, improving search performance.

7. Responsive and Interactive Design

    The UI is dynamically responsive, adjusting layout elements based on window resizing events.
    Keyboard bindings, such as pressing 'Return' to initiate a search, make the interface highly interactive.
    Mouse wheel support allows for smooth navigation through long lists of media files.

8. Settings and Customization

    A separate settings window provides users with options to manage database configurations and customize search filters.
    Users can enable or disable specific search criteria using intuitive checkboxes, tailoring the search experience to their preferences.

9. Performance Optimizations

    Implements threading for resource-intensive operations, like database training and metadata extraction, ensuring the UI remains responsive.
    Displays a progress bar and uses text-to-speech notifications to inform users about the progress and completion of long-running tasks.

10. Configuration and State Persistence

    The application uses configparser to save crucial settings, such as the last opened directory, window size, and user preferences, ensuring these are restored on the next launch.
    This feature provides a consistent and seamless user experience across sessions.

11. Main Event Loop

    The script loads initial settings, updates the display, and runs the tkinter main event loop, keeping the application active and responsive to user interactions.

12. Portable and Lightweight

    The application is designed to be portable and can be run on various systems without needing extensive dependencies.
    All necessary configurations and binaries are managed locally, allowing the application to be easily moved between different computers or environments.

13. Downloading Missing Binaries (ffmpeg and ffprobe)

    The application includes a built-in feature to check for the presence of ffmpeg and ffprobe binaries, which are essential for media metadata extraction.
    If these binaries are missing, the application automatically provides an option to download and install them, ensuring a seamless setup process.
    Users are guided through the download and installation process, with a fallback option to manually download the binaries if necessary.
