This Python script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application called "Media Indexer and Player" using the tkinter library. The application allows users to browse directories, display folder contents, and play media files. It also provides a search function to find media files within a specified folder and its subdirectories. The application saves the last directory and window size in a configuration file and restores it upon launch. Key features include:

1.    Importing necessary libraries such as os, tkinter, configparser, and re.
2.    Initializing the tkinter root window and configuring the ThemedStyle for the GUI.
3.    Defining functions for various tasks, including:
   -    Handling mouse wheel scrolling.
   -    Updating the display of folders and media files.
   -    Saving and loading the configuration file, which stores the last directory, window size, and paned window position.
   -    Opening folders and searching for media files.
   -    Displaying folder contents and media files in a grid layout.
4.    Setting up the GUI layout, which consists of:
   -    A top frame containing an "Open folder" button, a search entry box, and a "Search" button.
   -    A paned window that holds the folder frame and the media frame.
   -    A media canvas with a scrollbar for displaying the media files.
5.    Binding various events to their respective handlers, such as:
   -    Resizing the window, which triggers an update of the display.
   -    Pressing the 'Return' key, which performs a search.
   -    Closing the window, which saves the last directory and window size.
6.    Loading the last directory, updating the display, and starting the tkinter main event loop.
